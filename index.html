        <p> An Algorithm for procedural generation which utilises
            a grid of blank tiles which can be collapsed into one
            of several possibilities for other tiles. Every iteration
            the tile with the least possibilities is collapsed 
            randomly into one of its options removing any impossible
            tiles from neighbors having the changes propagate outwards

            The idea for this project came from:
